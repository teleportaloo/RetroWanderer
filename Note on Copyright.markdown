Hi;
Good to hear that someone is still getting some enjoyment out of it.
**As long as it is open-source and free in the app store I'm OK with it being there** (thanks for letting me know, by the way).  No problem with you adding a voluntary donation button for your work.  Hopefully it still has the credits/about info available in the app so that the various people involved get their 15min of fame?
I don't have an iThingy myself, so I can't see it, but hopefully it will get popular :).  Send me the URL for the appstore link when it is approved and I'll mention it on my Wanderer page.
Were you at Warwick uni?  That's where I developed it.  The final-final dev version was only available there and Edinburgh uni (who were beta testers), and I lost the dev source code (which was on 9-track reel tape) when I emigrated to New Zealand. 
Thanks,
Steve

Hi Steve - for some reason I spent a few months on-and-off porting wanderer to the iPad.  It’s awaiting approval from Apple in the Apple store.  I used the original C code for the engine, and the original 60 screens,  and I used real sprites for the graphics (this was the hardest part!) and added Game Center and controller support.  

Of course it has to remain open source - so all the source is here:   https://github.com/teleportaloo/RetroWanderer - and it will be free in the app store, but I may add a “Donote me a buck” button as it did take rather a long time to get it all working.

(I used to play the game when I was a graduate student in 1990 and really wanted other people to be playing it again).

It isn’t yet approved in the store but it might turn up tomorrow…

Thanks again for the original so many years ago…

Andy Wallace
